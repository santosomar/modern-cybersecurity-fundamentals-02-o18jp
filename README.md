- Important Cybersecurity Resources in O'Reilly: https://hackertraining.org

## Course Outline
- **Day 1** — You will dive right into core topics. Learn the basics, focusing on security concepts and exploring the core cybersecurity focus areas, along with incident response, threat hunting, and digital forensics.
- **Day 2** — Now you’ll take your skills to the next level by exploring security operations, access control, ethical hacking, AI security, adversarial emulation, and security management. You will then explore cloud security, Internet of Things (IoT) security, and mobile device security. You will learn the importance of a secure development lifecycle (SDLC) before delving into how cyber security is affecting software development (including DevOps and cloud computing), as well as the concept of DevSecOps. You will be able to discuss various security technologies, including anti-malware, firewalls, intrusion detection systems, sniffers, ethical hacking tools, active defense, and threat hunting.

This comprehensive training is the foundation for learning everything you need to know to start your cybersecurity career. It will also help you prepare for numerous certifications, including CompTIA Security+, Cisco CyberOps Associate, Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH), GIAC Information Security Fundamentals (GISF), or the GIAC Security Essentials (GSEC).

## What You’ll Learn and How You Can Apply It

By the end of the live online course, you’ll understand:
- Cybersecurity fundamentals and core cyber skills
- Threats, vulnerabilities, and exploits in today’s world and their associated risk
- The basics on incident response, digital forensics, network and host telemetry, PenTesting, cloud security, AI security, and so much more

And you’ll be able to:
- Learn the fundamentals of the major cybersecurity concentrations such as incident response, digital forensics, ethical hacking, AI security, governance, compliance, and risk management
- Communicate with confidence regarding cybersecurity topics, terms, and concepts
- Learn about complex cybersecurity subjects in simple terms
